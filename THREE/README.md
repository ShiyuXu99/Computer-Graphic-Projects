This directory contains files taken from the THREE.js distribution.

The file "three.js-master" was downloaded from https://threejs.org/ on Feb 23, 2019 and the files here were taken from it.

The "threets" directory is the typescript definitions for three. It comes through node (automatically via Visual Studio Code). However, I copied it here so we can refer to it directly.
